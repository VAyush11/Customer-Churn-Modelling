# Customer-Churn-Modelling

Customer Churn modelling was a term project undertaken by myself and 4 group members for our BC2406: Analytics I - Visual & Predictive Analytics course. For this project, our group created predictive models to analyse customer churn, and gauge the important variables that affect it. We then shared our findings with and suggested prevention mechanisms to the target company's management, in a typical consulting-oriented case. 

As part of this project, we also analysed several different dynamics and delivery-styles of  customer service, including by phone, in-person, written means etc., to arrive at a comprehensive picture of how today's asset managers should holistically approach customer service and customer churn.

As such, the works of this repository are the joint efforts of our entire group (Kathleen, Shao Yu, Wanxuan, Elliot, Ayush)
